# Designing a dictionary

# Dict is nothing but a key-value pair. {"apple": 5}
# Dict is used for O(1) lookup in a runtine.

# Dict is also used in programming language's runtime. 
# This is done in symbolic tables. If you have variables, or functions
# The memory location of these variables, function, program routines is stored in a table called symbolic table
# This table is nothing but a key-value store, or a dictionary.

# Next, it is important to note that we can only store immutable data-types as dictionary keys, like int, str, or tuple
# mutable data types like lists are not allowed.
