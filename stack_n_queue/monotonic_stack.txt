# Monotonic Stack

# to get$the next greater element
# or the next smaller element
# or the previous greater or previous smaller element
# we use a monotonic stack 
# Monotonic simply means the same fashion
# so at any point in time, 
# all elements in the stack are 
# either increasing or decreasing (last to first, as LIFO)


# for the next greater element, we use a MIS 
# and go from right to left
# This ensures that at any given time, the stack holds all elements greater than the current element, 
# and the top of the stack is the immediate next greater element.


# for the next smaller element, we use a MDS
# and go from right to left
# This ensures that the stack always holds elements that are smaller than the current element, 
# and the top of the stack represents the immediate next smaller element.


# Previous Greater or Smaller Elements
# The strategy is similar but traverse the array from left to right. 
# For previous greater elements, we use a MDS,
# and for previous smaller elements, a MIS


# Summary
# For the next greater element: Use a Monotonically Increasing Stack (MIS) and traverse from right to left.
# For the next smaller element: Use a Monotonically Decreasing Stack (MDS) and traverse from right to left.
# For the previous greater element: Use a Monotonically Decreasing Stack (MDS) and traverse from left to right.
# For the previous smaller element: Use a Monotonically Increasing Stack (MIS) and traverse from left to right.
